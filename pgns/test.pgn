This was my first year being invited but I didn't make the cut for the top section. Instead I was put in the Challenger section. The winner of the challenge section is garaunteed an invitation to the next years top section. I went into this tournament, like every tournament with optimism but I quickly realized that I wasn't going to perform too well. I don't like making excuses so I won't, but know that I played pretty terrible. The only person in the event I was determined to beat was Paul Anderson, an expert from Colorado Springs. It wasn't a personal vendetta or anything (I had never met him before) but between his style and his arrogant newsletters that he sends out, I just had a burning desire to checkmate him. We joked before the game that this would end up either in one of his newsletters or on my youtube channel. Maybe both. } 1... d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 { This is the Tarrasch Defense to the Queens Gambit. I have never played it in tournament play or in blitz this is my absolute first exposure to the opening. As it was a round robin, I knew a week or two in advance who I was playing with what color. I was torn as to what to play against Paul. I wanted something sharp but Paul's opening repetiore is deliberately designed to avoid the type of complications I revel in. } 4. cxd5 Nf6 $6 { An opening inaccuracy already on move 4. I learned after the fact that this is called the Dutch-Peruvian Gambit. } (4... cxd4 5. Qxd4 Nc6 6. Qa4 exd5 { This is the main line. }) 5. Bg5 cxd4 (5... Qb6 { [%emt 0:00:00] } 6.
